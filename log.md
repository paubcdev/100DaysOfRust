# #100DaysOfCode challenge Rust log

* Day 1 (24/10/2022): downloaded Rust, started building the framework, compiled and ran "Hello world" program.
* Day 2 (25/10/2022): checked the "cargo" builder/manager, and how it works. Started working on understanding variables.
* Day 3 (26/10/2022): continued working on variables. Learned how data types work, checked constants, variable "shadowing", and tuples.
* Day 4 (27/10/2022): short day, started working on functions.
* Day 5 (28/10/2022): second day of functions that return values, worked on arrays and looked at how "if" expressions work.
* Day 6 (29/10/2022): decided to review the first week of concepts learnt by making a simple program to check if a given number is prime.
* Day 7 (30/10/2022): started looking into the package manager (crates), that uses cargo, wrote a simple code to generate random numbers
* Day 8 - 9 (31/10/2022 & 1/11/2022): heavy theory days, understanding the first steps in the concept of ownership in the language
* Day 10 (2/11/2022): referencing variables and the borrowing concept
* Day 11 (3/11/2022): started training with katas from codewars.com
* Day 12 (4/11/2022): continued training katas
* Day 13 (5/11/2022): more katas
* Day 14 (6/11/2022): vectors
* Day 15 (7/11/2022): hash maps and how they work
* Day 16 (8/11/2022): handling errors, part 1 and kata example
* Day 17 (9/11/2022): handling errors, part 2: Options and Results
* Day 18 (10/11/2022): kata training
* Day 19 (11/11/2022): algorithm training with katas
* Day 20 (12/11/2022): more algo training
* Day 21 (13/11/2022): structs, part 1
* Day 22 (14/11/2022): kata training, but selecting specific ones to review important already-learned concepts
* Day 23 (15/11/2022): structs, part 2, specifically methods
* Day 24 (17/11/2022): kata training
* Day 25 (19/11/2022): minigrep clone, part 1
* Day 26 (20/11/2022): minigrep clone, part 2, refactored code, updated functions and error handling
* Day 27 (21/11/2022): minigrep clone, part 3, refactored logic, divided code into two files
* Day 28 (22/11/2022): minigrep clone, part 4, wrote autotesting feature, updated search function
* Day 29 (24/11/2022): testing, part 1
