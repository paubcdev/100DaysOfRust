# #100DaysOfCode challenge Rust log

* Day 1 (24/10/2022): downloaded Rust, started building the framework, compiled and ran "Hello world" program.
* Day 2 (25/10/2022): checked the "cargo" builder/manager, and how it works. Started working on understanding variables.
* Day 3 (26/10/2022): continued working on variables. Learned how data types work, checked constants, variable "shadowing", and tuples.
